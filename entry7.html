<h1>HEALTHIER COOKIE SKILLET</h1>

<div class="container">
	<div class="recipeprocess">
		<p>This week's recipe is dedicated to my mom (and her friend of 40+ years, Tonie). My mom is not much of a baker, but is a great chef, so us kids have always decided to take on the dessert-making. My mom's friend Tonie has always been a close family friend, as we go on road trips, shopping sprees, and more together. Whenever we make a sweet treat that we think she will enjoy, my mom invites her over. <i>Or,</i> if we know she is coming over, one of us is always sure to make a dessert for her.<br><br>This week, I decided to celebrate my mom and her friendship by making her a healthy, quick treat, because she works so hard on everything she does, and is always in the kitchen preparing a beautiful meal.<br><br>

		First, blend the oats into a flour (1). Combine with baking powder and set aside.<br> <br> Melt butter, whisk eggs, and combine with milk and vanilla extract. Once fully mixed, add to the dry ingredients and mix in chocolate chips.<br>
