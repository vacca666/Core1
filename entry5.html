	<h1>PISTACHIO LATTE RECIPE!</h1>
</div>
<div class="container">

		<p>One of my favorite things to do is make coffee for others. I enjoy experimenting with different flavors, methods, and more to make a simple coffee more interesting. <br> I am trying to dedicate a recipe to loved ones for each week/entry. This week, my coffee is dedicated to my older sister <b>Julia,</b> because we love exploring cafes together. Today I have made a <b>cookie butter</b> spread latte, inspired by a menu item we both enjoy from Mokafe, a coffee spot nearby with great desserts and study areas. 

			

			<br> I use both pistachio and cookie butter spread for this recipe. This time, I chose to do pistachio since we did not have any of the other kind (Nutella could work too). I first warm up my spread in the microwave for about 25 seconds. This can be enjoyed hot or iced, and this time I made one of each. Then, I generally use 2 shots of espresso, and brew them on top of the warmed up spread. I mix slowly until the everything no longer feels lumpy or congealed, and starts to thicken and mix with the coffee to create a paste-like texture. <br> Let that sit and start preparing the cup itself; grab a glass and pour a generous/desired amount of ice to cool the epresso, then fill the cup about halfway (or with desired amount) of milk of choice. Top with the espresso and mix vigorously (may need more ice)--pretty simple. Enjoy!!!! </p>
