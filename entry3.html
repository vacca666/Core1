			<p> It is officially fall. This season has always meant the welcoming of comforting, involved dishes made to eat for dinner, paired with Sunday Night Football games playing in the background as they are being cooked. A classic example dish is one made by both sets of grandparents, aunts, uncles and my parents. That is, of course, pasta with tomato sauce and "polpetti," or meatballs (and in the winter, we throw some spare ribs in there to cook in the sauce). However, my paternal grandmother goes all out when it comes to making this dish, and I dedicated this meal to her!
			<br> 
			<br>
			I have many memories associated with this recipe, one of which being when I would visit my grandparents at their house, along with my cousins, aunts, and uncles. Her easiest dish (easiest in the sense that it is able to be multiplied and replicated fairly simply) is pasta with homemade tomato sauce and meatballs. We would always eat together, and I sat at the kids table with my cousins, while other relatives enjoyed the meal in the dining room a few feet over. 
			<br>
			<br> Even though many things have changed over the years, such as my grandparents selling their house, my grandpas passing away, etc., there has always been a consistency to gathering together as a family and sharing a familiar meal during the colder weather and take a break from the stressors of school or work. 
			<br> There are still many variations to a tomato sauce recipe, such as using fresh tomatoes, passatas, making a meat sauce, or creating "pasta alla norma," a typical Sicillian recipe made with fresh tomato sauce and topped with fried eggplant. This week, I have combined a little bit of all of these elements to kick off the season.

		<br>
		<p>The first step is to make the meatballs so that they can be fried ahead of time and placed into the sauce afterwards to soften and absorb all of its flavor. Mix ground meat, seasonings, bread, etc. in one bowl and roll into balls. Fry and set aside.

		<br> Get started on the sauce. Begin by adding leftover oil from meatballs into a pan with diced onion to let sautee. Puree the tomatoes seperately and pour in. Season accordingly and add meatballs to simmer once sauce is fully cooked. The longer this sits, the better. 
		<br>
		<p> Boil water and add pasta. Cook, strain, and place back into pot, making sure to mix in some scoops of sauce so as to prevent the pasta from sticking. Scoop and top with extra sauce on top if desired.
		<br> Usually, the meatballs are served in a seperate bowl and eaten after the pasta is eaten.
