	<h1>CHOCOLATE BIRTHDAY CAKE!</h1>

		<p>This weekend was my birthday. I decided to make my own cake, since I wanted to challenge myself and was missing my sister, so I dedicated this to her. My younger sister is away at school and she loves baking, so I have  been craving some homemade baked goods and was looking to share my process with her while we are apart. I <i>love</i> chocolate and my dream cake is a brooklyn blackout cake or the chooclate ganache cake featured in one of our favorite shows, <i>The Great British Bake Off.

			<br> First, I made my sponge. I used a Brooklyn Blackout cake recipe, with the most important ingredient being dutch processed cocoa powder (extra rich, cocoa powder). They bake for about 35 minutes, and in the meantime, I got started on the frostings. The filling was meant to be a chocolate ganache, although I ultimately failed at following a recipe for it because I used incorrect chocolate. But it was still okay, I guess. I didn't use a recipe for the frosting on the outside, but added ingredients such as both regular and dutch processed cocoa powder, powdered sugar, melted butter, vanilla, and instant espresso! <br> Once all elements were ready, I assembled, placing the ganache in between cake layers, and frosting the outside. The finishing touch was just to add sprinkles. Overall, I think the feat of making my own cake turned out to be delicious, except for the hiccup of my ganache. <br> I sent pictures to my sister, and we discussed the fact that she misses having an oven and being able to easily bake for her loved ones. Although I shared my cake through the screen with her, I'm sure she would have liked to have a piece in person. </p>
